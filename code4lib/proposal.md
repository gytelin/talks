== Data acquisition and publishing tools in R ==

* Scott Chamberlain,  scott@ropensci.org, rOpenSci/UC Berkeley

R is an open source programming environment that is widely used among researchers in many fields. R is powerful because it's free, increasingly robust, and facilitates reproducible research, an increasingly sought after goal in academia. Although tools for data manipulation/visualization/analysis are well developed in R, data acquisition and publishing tools are not. rOpenSci is a collaborative effort to create the tools necessary to complete the reproducible research workflow. This presentation discusses the need for these tools, including examples, including interacting with the repositories Mendeley, Dryad, DataONE, and Figshare. In addition, we are building tools for searching scholarly metadata and acuiring full text of open access articles in a standarized way across metadata providers (e.g., Crossref, DataCite, DPLA) and publishers (e.g., PLOS, PeerJ, BMC, Pubmed). Last, we are building out tools for data reading and writing in Ecologial Metadata Language (EML).
