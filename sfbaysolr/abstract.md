# An R client for Solr

Scott Chamberlain, rOpenSci/UC Berkeley

Solr is a widely used search engine tool. As such, the R community needs a client to talk to Solr - to simplify searching Solr installations, and even managing configurations, cores, collections, and documents. This talk will go over the R client in development, and run through a couple of use cases that should provide good reasons to interact with Solr from R.
